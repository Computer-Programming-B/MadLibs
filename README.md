Mad Libs
========
For this assignment we will use Python's `readline()` function to read in a blank MadLib. Then we will use `input()` function to ask the user for words from a particular part of speech (e.g. noun, adjective, verb, etc). Finally we'll use Python's `replace()` function to replace the blanks with user input.

Suggested steps to starting the assignment
------------------------------------------
You can use the following Mad Lib or make up your own:
```text
Adjective Macdonald had a Noun, E-I-E-I-O
and on that Noun he had an Animal, E-I-E-I-O
with a Noise Noise here
and a Noise Noise there,
here a Noise, there a Noise,
everywhere a Noise Noise,
Adjective Macdonald had a Noun, E-I-E-I-O.
```
